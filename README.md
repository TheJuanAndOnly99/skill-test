Apply TypeScript and testing to the technical test.

SCORE KEEPER
We need software to send the appropriate data to a basketball team's scoreboard. Unfortunately, the people using our software are not the brightest bulbs under the sun, so they need six buttons (each team can score 1, 2, or 3 points with a single shot).

‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Player

getName(): This function returns the name of the player.

üèÄ Team

getPlayers(): This function returns the list of players that make up the team.

üßÆ ScoreKeeper

scoreTeamA1(): This function scores 1 point for team A.

scoreTeamA2(): This function scores 2 points for team A.

scoreTeamA3(): This function scores 3 points for team A.

scoreTeamB1(): This function scores 1 point for team B.

scoreTeamB2(): This function scores 2 points for team B.

scoreTeamB3(): This function scores 3 points for team B.

getScore(): This function returns the current score in the format "000:000".

üìê Scoring Rules

It consists of seven characters.

The string format is "000:000", where the first three characters represent the score of team A and the last three characters represent the score of team B.

Each character in the string represents a decimal digit (0-9), and no spaces or special characters are used.

üèÅ Game

getShot(): This function will be a promise where a random shot of x points will be made for one of the two teams. The shot will have a delay of 2 seconds.

play(): This function will start the game and call getShot 10 times. Once the game is finished, it will return the final score.
